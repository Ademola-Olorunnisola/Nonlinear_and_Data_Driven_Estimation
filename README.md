# Nonlinear and Data Driven Estimation

This repository accompanies a course I teach at UNR on nonlinear and data driven estimation.

[Tips on getting started with GitHub, Google Colab, and Docker](github_colab_tips.md)

## Lesson 1: Dynamics Demo

Includes:
  *  Example of defining a nonlinear dynamical system as a control affine system, and simulating the system with python using model predictive control.
  *  Example showing how to create an animation of the simulated system with matplotlib. 

## Lesson 2: Batch least squares

Includes:
  *  Parameter estimation with batch least squares 
  *  Relation to statistics

## Lesson 3: Sequential least squares

Includes:
  *  Linear sequential estimation
  *  Random variables, covariance

## Lesson 4: Minimum variance estimation

Includes:
  *  Minimum variance estimation
  *  Cramer Rao Bound

## Lesson 5: Linear discrete Kalman filter

Includes:
  *  Linearizing and discretizing a continuous time nonlinear model
  *  Discrete linear kalman filter
